Investment Calculator

The Investment Calculator is a web-based financial tool that helps users estimate the future value of their investments. By entering values such as initial investment, annual contribution, expected annual return, and duration, users can instantly view a comprehensive year-by-year breakdown of their investment performance.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical financial computation, clean UI design, component-based architecture, and interactive React state handling.
